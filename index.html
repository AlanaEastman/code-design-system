  <h1>This is my Design system!</h1>
  <p>Hi everyone, welcome to my design system! For a school project, I was asked to make a product that will add something to the digital commons. 
    Let me explain what that means.</p>

  <p>Commons are things that can be used by all members of a group or a society. In terms of design, there are not a lot of options when we are talking about commons. 
    Figma has a community page which sounds pretty good, but there is one problem. You can only use it within Figma. You can not use it in another program. 
    Figma does have an inspect page, but this code is not always as accurate as you want it to be.</p>

  <p>That's why I decided to code the page myself. I wanted this design system to be much more complete, but because I had to code the page and had other school work 
    to do, this is all I could manage to do in this short amount of time. </p>

  <p>I have a few extra pages on the figma page, so if you are curious you can check it out! <a href="#">Link to my figma page</a></p>

  <p>Even though it is a small design system, I still hope it will be usefull to somebody!</p>

  <p>Thank you for looking at my design system, and I hope that you will have a great day. :)</p>
